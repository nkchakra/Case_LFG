Gantt Chart says I should be working on mapping out JSON Objects. 
I spent some time reading up on JSON formatting, JSON Response Objects, and general frontend backend communciation. 
Response objects should be what is communicated between the frontend and backend containing the relevant data needed. 
Waiting on Vishal and Nikhil to set up the basic framework of backend and framework to start working on the functions between the two. 
Created pseudocode files user.json, post.json, comment.json to mimic response objects.
