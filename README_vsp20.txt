Made main feed look and read better, also took out carousel for now due some minor issues, will come back to it a little later. Added a new component which will in the future act as the component for a standard post. With certain input fields a new post looking component will be available rather than just normal text. For now since the backend isn't connected I will be using mock information. Also added a little more to the "Create a Post" portion of the main feed so that it looks more welcoming for the user.

Started making the introuction to the main feed's UX better for the user experience. Added in a carousel to help with the user onboarding. Also figured out and fixed some problems with the react-bootstrap styling which in turn helped myself with the carousel and Isaac with his tabs work on the main feed. Posting mechanic is now also built out ready to be connected with the backend

Did some styling on Isaac's front-end additions, also started working on implementation of the onboarding carousel so user's can easily learn how to use the product. Finished the welcome block and started planning for the main feed/implementation next week.

Some github errors/mis communications happened so I had to recreate the react app/front end of the site again due to some important files being deleted. Also finished up the welcome tab for the main feed which will act as a welcome banner and give some instructions in the future on how to use the app (coming once the main feed is built out)

Started on the welcome page, where users will see upon first entering the site. We had some merge conflicts already so we as a group had to figure those out which took a lot longer than expected. For the welcome page I created a welcome component and used some of the existing react-bootstrap components to create a clean looking welcome page, so far the button and UX isn't where it should be, which is going to be my task for the coming week.

Set up most of react bootstrap and did all the necessary imports from the bootstrap library to set myself up for the coming weeks of react. Ran into issues with getting the website up and running. I edited the App.js, index.js and index.html files.
