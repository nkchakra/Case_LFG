Did some styling on Isaac's front-end additions, also started working on implementation of the onboarding carousel so user's can easily learn how to use the product. Finished the welcome block and started planning for the main feed/implementation next week.

Some github errors/mis communications happened so I had to recreate the react app/front end of the site again due to some important files being deleted. Also finished up the welcome tab for the main feed which will act as a welcome banner and give some instructions in the future on how to use the app (coming once the main feed is built out)

Started on the welcome page, where users will see upon first entering the site. We had some merge conflicts already so we as a group had to figure those out which took a lot longer than expected. For the welcome page I created a welcome component and used some of the existing react-bootstrap components to create a clean looking welcome page, so far the button and UX isn't where it should be, which is going to be my task for the coming week.

Set up most of react bootstrap and did all the necessary imports from the bootstrap library to set myself up for the coming weeks of react. Ran into issues with getting the website up and running. I edited the App.js, index.js and index.html files.
