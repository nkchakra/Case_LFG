Backend AWS EC2 instance has been created, MySQL server and Apache Web Server have been installed. 
The "details" text file has the important information needed to access the instance and use the MySQL server.

The Apache Web Server is tested to work (shows the default index.html page), and I can easily SSH in and out of the AWS EC2 instance at this stage. 
Now, I have set up the 'Users' and 'Posts' data tables in the MySQL database hosted on the EC2 instance. I have also started coding the connection (in Java) to the MySQL database. 
Next week will be finishing up the table schema so that it is organized and moving forward, I will be adding data table functions to the Java code.
