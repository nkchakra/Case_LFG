Gantt Chart says I should be working on implementing filter functionality. 
For now, I'm working on a dummy React Object in order to do basic search filtering. When we fully implement backend's data tables, I will adjust the script accordingly
to get the backend data tables and filter through the results instead of just a front end dummy object (will have to read up and implement nodejs for this). 
Due to this, I spent some time working on researching React (how to install and create a basic component). npm install, then npm start in case-lfg folder to load. 
Created folder Components and inside file Results.js.

Gantt Chart says I should be working on mapping out JSON Objects. 
I spent some time reading up on JSON formatting, JSON Response Objects, and general frontend backend communciation. 
Response objects should be what is communicated between the frontend and backend containing the relevant data needed. 
Waiting on Vishal and Nikhil to set up the basic framework of backend and framework to start working on the functions between the two. 
Created pseudocode files user.json, post.json, comment.json to mimic response objects.
